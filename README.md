# To-find-the-mean-difference-between-parents-and-child-heights
The data frame galton data set in UsingR library has data collected by Francis Galton
in 1885. Each data point contains a child’s height and an average of his or her parent’s
height. Do an appropriate test if there is a difference in the mean height.
